## Navbar Component

The `Navbar` component is a responsive navigation bar for the portfolio website. It uses React's `useState` to toggle the mobile menu between open and closed states. The navbar is fixed at the top of the page with a semi-transparent black background. It includes a logo ("Jordan") that links to the homepage and a button for toggling the mobile menu. The menu icon switches between a hamburger icon and a close icon based on the state.

### Features:
- Mobile-responsive with a toggle menu.
- Fixed at the top of the page.
- Simple styling with Tailwind CSS.
